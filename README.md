#GFG-Hackathon
This repository contains the submission files for the GFG Hackathon organized by IIT Guwahati, known as DataHack By IIT Guwahati.

#Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of individuals receiving two types of vaccines:

XYZ vaccine
Seasonal flu vaccine

Specifically, we are tasked with predicting two probabilities:

One for the XYZ vaccine
One for the seasonal flu vaccine
